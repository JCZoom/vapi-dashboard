## Changing a Mailbox Number for a Customer

However, in exceptional cases where a mailbox number must be changed, this can be done through your admin dashboard. It is crucial that the customer is notified in advance before any changes are made. Use the Admin Portal Dashboard to send an email from our system to inform the customer of the mailbox number update to ensure a smooth transition and to avoid confusion. To Email the customer: 1.

## Service Level Agreement

Download PDF Summary The iPostal1 Service Level Agreement outlines the expectations for mail center partners to deliver secure, reliable, and efficient service to digital mailbox customers. Key responsibilities include approving new customer mailboxes within 48 hours, ensuring all incoming mail is inserted the same day, completing mail task requests received by 1 PM on the same business day, and adhering to fair pricing practices for shipping. Partners must also ensure proper processing of mail pickups, maintaining a legal chain of custody and verifying customer identity. iPostal1 provides daily support during business hours to address any issues promptly. By upholding these standards, mail center partners build customer trust, drive positive reviews, and contribute to mutual growth in digital mailbox services. As part of the iPostal1 Master Services Agreement, you have agreed to uphold the promises we publicize to your customers. Your customers have put their trust in you to handle their personal and confidential mail and packages in a secure and time sensitive manner. 1. Customer Approval within 48 hours . When you receive new customers, approve their mailbox within 48 hours. Customers will not be able to use their digital mailbox until you approve their form 1583 at your location. You will receive 1583 forms ready for your review and acceptance. Note: As the CMRA, you control who you accept as a customer, and must adhere to the CMRA terms of agreement between your location and the USPS. 2. Inserting mail upon receipt. All incoming mail should be inserted into the customer’s mailbox the same day it arrives. Note: Never insert mail for a person or business not listed on the corresponding 1583 form. 3. Same day service. All mail task requests received by 1pm must be completed the same business day. All requests received after 1pm must be completed by the end of the next business day. Our team is available to support you daily by answering your questions during standard business hours (9 AM5PM) Eastern Standard Time.

Unreasonable shipping costs result in customer dissatisfaction, customer support emails and calls, bad reviews, and high churn rates. Please note, the markups in the iPostal1 shipping setup are on top of the retail shipping price. Charging the retail price (a markup of 1x) or slightly above 1.2x is in most cases sufficient when taking into consideration your location’s carrier discounts. If your location does not have carrier discounts or low carrier discounts a 40- 50% markup on top of retail (1.4x-1.5x) should be the maximize charged. 5. Correct Pickup processing. You are responsible for recording the legal chain of custody for mail pickups in the iPostal1 system. All mail pickups must be processed through the iPostal1 system at the time the customer arrives to retrieve their mail items. Double check that the mail given to the customer is only for their mailbox. Note: Please remember to ask for ID to verify the customer's identity before handing over any mail items. As with every business, the best way to grow the digital mailbox revenues in your location is by the word of mouth and great reviews that are the result of the trust you build and service you provide to your digital mailbox customers. We look forward to partnering with you and building your digital mailbox customer base and revenues together.

Please be mindful to match uppercase and lowercase letters, al ong with any punctuation in your company’s legal name. If you see your Mail Center name defaulting in the company line, and it is a DBA, you should edit this field to correctly reflect your company name that you submit to the IRS.

Compliant - Recipient' s documents are all current and uploaded to the USPS BCG. Compliant by Mail Center - You chose to handle document uploads manually. Resubmission Required - Docs are expired or outdated and new documents are required. Resubmission Started - iPostal1 has notified the recipient to re-notarize the updated form 1583. Resubmission Pending Approval - Customer completed notary and was preapproved by iPostal1. Docs Received in Mail Center - You’ve uploaded documents manually from in store completion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why is there a different amount of active customers in the Compliance Center vs. the Admin portal?

Customers with no documents appear in the Admin portal but will not appear in the Compliance Center. These customers have no documents to be uploaded to the BCG, therefore, it is not applicable to them and no action necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why can’t I see all my customers?

The Compliance Center contains all active iPostal1 customers with documents. The Compliance Center displays 25 customers per page. Be sure to scroll to the bottom and check all available pages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why don’t some customers ever change to the Compliant status?

'Docs received in mail center' means that you physically handled the customers 1583 and IDs in your location. We are not able to upload these customers to the BCG for you, since the documents were handled outside the iPostal1 system. Since we are unable to confirm the status of those customers that you handled in store, their status will remain as 'Docs received in mail center', even if they are in the BCG. We do not have access to those BCG records. When you add the customer to the BCG, you should then change the status to 'Compliant by Mail center' .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How long does it take for the Compliance Center to refresh after a customer is added to the BCG?

If you are participating in the iPostal1 CMRA Support Program, you may not see a customer change to the Compliant status immediately. You will see them change to ‘Upload pending.’ We recommend that you check back in 24 hours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What if I join the iPostal1 CMRA Support Program after I’ve already uploaded many customers on my own?

When iPostal1 attempts to upload these accounts to the BCG, our system will detect that an account already exists for each customer. They will then be automatically marked as compliant, and no additional charge will be applied to your location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are “Resubmissions” and how does that work?

Resubmissions are customers that have the old Form 1583, prior to July 10th, 2023. These customers need to complete, notarize, and submit a new form in order to remain compliant with USPS requirements. You can authorize iPostal1 to handle the resubmission process for you, via the Compliance Center.

For mailbox locations outside of the U.S.: Please contact your local post office for more information on how to forward your mail. Alternate option: Is to simply tell your contacts directly that your address has changed. This is what most customers do that want most of their mail still coming to their home address, and want the iPostal1 address to be there for business use. To ensure you receive mail to your new mailing address, after your account is fully approved: 1. Inform your senders and contacts of your new address. 2. File a Temporary Change of Address form with your local post office.

For mailbox locations outside of the U.S. please contact your local post office for more information.
