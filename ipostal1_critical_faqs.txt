QUESTION: Do I have to get the Form 1583 notarized?
QUESTION: Is notarization required for the 1583 form?
================================================================================

ANSWER: Yes, the USPS requires notarization of Form 1583 to prevent identity fraud. iPostal1 requires you to notarize your documents either:
1. Online using proof.com ($25 fee), OR
2. In person at your mail center if the service is available

You cannot skip notarization. Local notaries such as banks or post offices are NOT accepted.

QUESTION: Can I use my own notary for the 1583 form?
QUESTION: Can I use a bank notary?
QUESTION: Can I notarize at a UPS store?
QUESTION: Can I use a personal notary?
================================================================================

ANSWER: No. Local notaries such as banks, post offices, UPS stores, or other personal notaries are NOT acceptable for Form 1583 notarization.

Your Form 1583 must be signed and notarized using ONLY one of these two methods:
1. The online notary proof.com, OR
2. In person at the physical mail center address you signed up for (if the service is available)

If you have already notarized using a local notary (bank, post office, etc.), that document will NOT be accepted and you will need to notarize again using one of the two acceptable methods.
